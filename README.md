# RoboticArm

All of this was made in 2022, before ChatGPT.

In order to use:
1. Donwload Blender and open the LeArmBlendFinalPortfolio.blend file.
2. Follow the documentation written in the script tab. In case you do not see it, here it is:  In order to use, connect power supply and usb to LeArm controller board. Connect Rx to Tx and Tx to Rx (see what arduino serial pins are in arduino program) between arduino and robot controller. Connect USB to arduino and upload arduino program first. In blender, press spacebar and start the animation player in the view. Then, run this script. Make sure to only run the script one time. Otherwise, running it multuple times will cause COM3 to fail, as there will already be a connection on it.
